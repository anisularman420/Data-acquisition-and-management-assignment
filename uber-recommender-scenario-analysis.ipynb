    "# Scenario Design Analysis: Uber Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selected Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber is a ride-sharing platform that connects riders with drivers through a mobile app. It uses recommender systems to suggest ride types, pickup locations, optimal driving times, and areas of high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Who are your target users?\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber has two main types of users:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Riders**: People who use the Uber app to request rides for transportation.\n",
    "* **Drivers**: Independent contractors who use the platform to offer rides or deliveries and earn income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group interacts with the system differently and has different needs and goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What are their key goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Riders' goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To get to their destination quickly and safely.\n",
    "* To find affordable ride options.\n",
    "* To reduce waiting times.\n",
    "* To access convenient features like scheduled rides or preferred pickup points.\n",
    "* To receive discounts or promotions based on their usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drivers' goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To increase the number of trips and earnings.\n",
    "* To spend less time waiting for ride requests.\n",
    "* To know the best areas and times to go online for high demand.\n",
    "* To get matched with preferred types of rides.\n",
    "* To maintain high ratings for more trip opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. How can you help them accomplish those goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helping Riders:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suggest the most suitable ride types based on past trips or location.\n",
    "* Recommend ideal pickup spots to shorten wait times.\n",
    "* Offer discounts and personalized promotions.\n",
    "* Provide real-time information on estimated arrival times and fare costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helping Drivers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Show heat maps with high-demand areas to increase trip chances.\n",
    "* Recommend best times to drive based on traffic and rider activity.\n",
    "* Suggest trips that align with the driver’s preferences.\n",
    "* Offer feedback and performance insights to help maintain a high rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reverse Engineering Uber’s Recommendation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "From app usage and public resources, Uber likely uses a combination of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trip history and behavior patterns to suggest rides.\n",
    "* Location and time data to match supply and demand.\n",
    "* Ratings and feedback to influence driver-passenger pairings.\n",
    "* Real-time traffic and demand changes to update recommendations on the go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber uses both rider preferences and live conditions to deliver relevant suggestions to its users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add simple explanations for why certain ride types are being suggested.\n",
    "* Show which rides are popular in the area to help users feel confident in their choice.\n",
    "* Offer environmentally friendly ride suggestions when possible.\n",
    "* Allow users to plan multiple trips in advance with smart recommendations.\n",
    "* Use rider and driver feedback to improve the relevance of future suggestions.\n",
    "\n"
