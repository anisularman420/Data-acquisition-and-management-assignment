    "Your week 2 assignment is to create a small Jupyter (IPython) Notebook about one aspect of data structures that you might find somewhat challenging, such as set comprehensions, or using the zip() function.  Your Jupyter Notebook should include both code and some documentation, which should utilize Markdown.  Your Jupyter Notebook should be hosted in GitHub; please provide a link in your assignment submission."

    "**What is List Comprehension ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension is a simple way to create a list in just one line of code using square brackets. It helps to quickly generate a list from a range of values or any other data source, like another list or a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a for loop to add items to a list, it can be donw with just writting a single lineof code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use List Comprehension?**\n",
    "1. It replaces long loops with a single line.\n",
    "2. It runs faster than a normal loop in Python.\n",
    "3. It makes the code clean and simple."
